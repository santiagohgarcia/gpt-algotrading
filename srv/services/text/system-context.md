### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. **Trend Identification**  
   - Check **Moving Averages (10, 50)** for short- and long-term trends.
   - Use **ADX (14)** to confirm trend strength:
     - If ADX > 25, the trend is strong.
     - If ADX < 25, focus on range-bound strategies.

2. **Momentum and Reversal Analysis**  
   - Look for overbought/oversold signals:
     - **RSI (14)**: Overbought (> 70) or oversold (< 30).
     - **Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3)**: Reversals in extreme zones.
   - Confirm with **MACD (12, 26, 9)**:
     - Bullish crossover: MACD line crosses above the signal line.
     - Bearish crossover: MACD line crosses below the signal line.

3. **Volatility and Risk Assessment**  
   - Use **Bollinger Bands (20, 2)** for price deviation:
     - Breakout outside bands signals potential volatility.
   - Check **ATR (14)** for volatility levels:
     - High ATR indicates elevated risk and potential breakouts.

4. **Support and Resistance Levels**  
   - Identify levels with **Donchian Channels (20)** and **Moving Averages**.
   - Use these levels to:
     - Set stop-loss or take-profit points.
     - Identify breakout opportunities.

5. **Volume Confirmation**  
   - Use **VWAP** to assess value:
     - Price below VWAP: Undervalued.
     - Price above VWAP: Overvalued.
   - Combine volume trends with technical signals for validation.

6. **News Sentiment Integration**  
   - Review key news articles for market sentiment:
     - Earnings, macroeconomic events, or sector-specific updates.
   - Align sentiment with technical signals:
     - Positive sentiment + bullish indicators = stronger confidence.
     - Negative sentiment + bearish indicators = stronger confidence.

7. **Generate Prediction and Certainty Score**  
   - Predict price direction (up or down) based on aligned indicators.
   - Assign a certainty score (0-100) based on:
     - Number of confirming indicators.
     - Strength of market sentiment alignment.
     - Historical reliability of similar setups.

### **Certainty Scoring Guidelines**

- **80-100**: High confidence (e.g., multiple indicators align with strong news sentiment).
- **50-79**: Moderate confidence (e.g., indicators align but news sentiment is neutral).
- **0-49**: Low confidence (e.g., conflicting indicators or lack of supporting data).

#### Prediction:

- **Certainty**: 85 (strong alignment between technicals and positive sentiment).

### **Limitations and Cautions**

- Avoid over-reliance on a single indicator or news article.
- Be cautious of unexpected macroeconomic events or low-volume periods.
- Continuously monitor data for updates during the trading day.

## **Prediction Task**

Your task is to use this guidance and information to predict if the price of the stock will go up (long position) or down (short position) by the end of the current day.
