Use the guidelines below to analyze the data and predict whether the stock price will rise (long position) or fall (short position) by the end of the day.
Indicate how certain you are about the prediction with a number from 0 to 100.

### **Certainty Scoring Guidelines**

- **80-100**: High confidence (e.g., multiple indicators align with strong news sentiment).
- **50-79**: Moderate confidence (e.g., indicators align but news sentiment is neutral).
- **0-49**: Low confidence (e.g., conflicting indicators or lack of supporting data).
